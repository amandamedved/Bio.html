<DIV ID="Biography">
<p>Hi, my name is Amanda Medved and I am a recent graduate of the University of Washington in Seattle. I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in English and a minor in Environmental Studies. I am passionate about all things writing, and am especially interested in Technical Writing and UX Writing.</p>

<p>I was born and raised in Seattle, Washington, and currently have plans to stay here for at least the next year as I work out my transition into the workforce. I grew up in a small neighborhood called Magnolia, and attended Seattle Preparatory High School before UW. Writing and analyzing text has always come easy to me, and I have always known that I wanted to be a writer in whatever career I choose for myself. When I was in high school, I had a teacher who taught me about the climate crisis and the importance of living sustainably. Ever since then, I have been passionate about promoting more sustainable lifestyles, and have a large interest in corporate sustainability.</p>

<p> In my free time, I love to binge new TV shows and movies, take yoga classes, spend time with family and friends, and travel. When the COVID-19 pandemic hit last year, I was studying abroad in Europe. Luckily, I was able to spend two and a half months there traveling to ten different countries before we were called home by the travel bans. Traveling abroad was one of my most cherished and enriching life experiences, and I will never forget fleeing from Prague in the middle of the night to get back home to the U.S.</p>

<p>I am currently taking a few classes to improve my skills in Technical Writing and UX Writing. My goals for the future are to find a full-time role or internship in one of these fields, and continue improving upon my skills and learning new things.
